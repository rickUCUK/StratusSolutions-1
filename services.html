					<h3>What We Do</h3>
					<p>Stratus Solutions is a trusted procurement and sourcing partner to government agencies, NHS
						trusts, councils, and commercial businesses across the UK. We provide a broad spectrum of
						solutions—from tech and infrastructure to specialty chemicals and emergency equipment—delivered
						quickly and in full compliance with regulatory standards.</p>

					<hr />

					<h4>Technology & Equipment Procurement</h4>
					<p>We supply laptops, tablets, enterprise hardware, telecommunications gear, and peripherals for
						educational bodies, healthcare trusts, and central government. Whether it's 1,500 iPads for the
						NHS or ruggedized tablets for field operations, we handle the entire sourcing lifecycle.</p>

					<h4>Industrial, Chemical & Oil-Based Sourcing</h4>
					<p>Our specialist procurement services cover industrial lubricants, lab-grade chemicals, technical
						oils, and bulk consumables. All supplies are verified, certified, and sourced via vetted UK and
						international suppliers in line with framework requirements.</p>

					<h4>PPE & Medical Supplies</h4>
					<p>From gloves and respirators to defibrillators and sanitisation systems, we supply high-quality,
						fully compliant PPE and clinical equipment. We also support emergency stockpiling, disaster
						response, and hospital infrastructure needs.</p>

					<h4>Public Sector Tender Fulfilment</h4>
					<p>We work closely with portals like <strong>Contracts Finder</strong> and <strong>Crown Commercial
							Service (CCS)</strong> to respond to tenders quickly and effectively. Our tender specialists
						identify opportunities, match requirements with supplier capabilities, and ensure fast,
						traceable fulfilment.</p>

					<h4>Multi-Category Sourcing Solutions</h4>
					<p>We manage complex, multi-category requests—whether it’s a single contract covering IT,
						construction materials, cleaning products, and HVAC units, or category-specific frameworks. With
						one point of contact, our clients simplify procurement without sacrificing accountability.</p>

					<h4>Contract Management & Reporting</h4>
					<p>We provide full reporting and transparency throughout the procurement lifecycle, with compliance
						documentation, digital tracking, and supplier performance reviews. Our contract support helps
						clients meet auditing, governance, and SLA compliance targets.</p>
